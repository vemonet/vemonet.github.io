[![Deploy to GitHub Pages](https://github.com/vemonet/vemonet.github.io/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/vemonet/vemonet.github.io/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)

## Getting Started

Personal website built with Gatsby, TypeScript and [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/).

```bash
yarn
```

Start in development:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000

_Note: You'll also see a second link: http://localhost:8000/___graphql. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).

Build in the `public` folder:

```bash
yarn build
```

> All the commands are in the `package.json` > `scripts`.
