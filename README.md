Deployed at **https://vemonet.github.io**

## 🔧 Development

Personal website built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Material UI](https://mui.com/core).

Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

Start in development:

```bash
yarn dev
```

The site is now running at http://localhost:8000

Note: there is also another access: http://localhost:8000/___graphql. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).

Build and serve (no hot reload, but deployment similar to prod)

```bash
yarn serve
```

## 📦️ Build

Build in the `public` folder:
